# RTCTunnel

RTCTunnel builds network tunnels over WebRTC.

# WARNING:

This is a proof of concept and should NOT be used in production. Errors/Exceptions like disconnects and invalid data are not well handled, and may result in panics.

An overview of the application and how and why it was built is available here: [RTCTunnel: Building a WebRTC Proxy with Go](http://www.doxsey.net/blog/rtctunnel--building-a-webrtc-proxy-with-go).

## Installation

RTCTunnel can be installed via `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/rtctunnel/rtctunnel@latest
```

Or downloaded from the releases page (for linux).

## Usage

RTCTunnel creates a network tunnel over WebRTC between two peers. Those peers are identified by a public key.

To use RTCTunnel first create a config with:

```bash
rtctunnel init
```

You can see info with:

```bash
rtctunnel info
```

Once you've done that on both peers, copy the two public keys and add a route. A route has four components: a local peer, a local port, a remote peer and a remote port. All network connections and data sent to the local port will be forwarded to the remote peer. For example:

```bash
export CLIENT_KEY=
export SERVER_KEY=
rtctunnel add-route \
    --local-peer=$CLIENT_KEY \
    --local-port=6379 \
    --remote-peer=$SERVER_KEY \
    --remote-port=6379
```

The route must be added on both peers and the `CLIENT_KEY` and `SERVER_KEY` should be set to the peer keys.

Once the routes are added you can run rtctunnel with:

```bash
rtctunnel run
```

Typically it would be run in the background.

A docker-compose example is available in [examples/redis](https://github.com/rtctunnel/rtctunnel/tree/master/examples/redis).

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in a yaml file based on [github.com/kirsle/configdir](https://github.com/kirsle/configdir):

```text
Linux:   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or "$HOME/.config"
Windows: %APPDATA% or "C:\\Users\\%USER%\\AppData\\Roaming"
macOS:   $HOME/Library/Application Support
```

You can see the path by running `rtctunnel help`.

### Signal Channel

In addition to the key pair and routes you can set the signal channel in the config:

```yaml
keypair:
  public: xxx
  private: xxx
routes: []
signalchannel: operator://localhost:8000
```

The default signal channel is `apprtc://` which uses a websocket server for [appr.tc](appr.tc).
